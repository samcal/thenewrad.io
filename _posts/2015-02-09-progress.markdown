I recently had a discussion with a friend of mine in which we were discussing
how mankind landed astronauts on the moon with incredibly weak computers by
today's standards. Following this logic, he concluded that we could not possibly
have landed the Apollo 11 on the moon, as we simply did not have the computing
power necessary to perform such a feat.

While the "faked moon landing hoax" is ridiculous for [other
reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGXTF6bs1IU), this point struck a chord with regard
to how we think of computers today. It's not as if Neil Armstrong simply pushed a
button that said "To the Moon", leaving a computer to get him and his crew
there. This sort of mission required, and in many ways still does require, an
intelligent human to know when, why, and how to do any sort of necessary maneuver.

The calculations we needed to compute were not difficult, definitely not so
difficult as to require supercomputers and massive data centers. All of the
calculations required to get to the moon can be done with a combination of
experimentation and a pocket calculator. We used computers to make instruments
that gave us data for the rocket's vital signs, to communicate with the rocket,
and to do simple calculations quickly.

Perhaps there will be a time when it is better to trust the lives of
space-faring humans to a computer over a human specialist. Until then, computers
will simply remain the trusty sidekick to the superheroic mathematician.
