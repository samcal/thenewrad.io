The symbiotic relationship is a wonderful example of the sheer complexity generated in a Darwinian system of evolution (or, of the sheer genius of an intelligent designer, if your preferred cup of origin-theory tea is bland and unsatisfying)[^1]. In an ecological system, a **symbiotic relationship** is between two or more species that have co-evolved to form a mutually-beneficial interaction. The classic example is a system in which a smaller fish will eat parasites off of a larger fish. The large fish benefits by being clean and parasite-free, and the small fish benefits by getting food.

These relationships develop over large timescales, on the order of millions of years. In fact, as the student of economics would point out, the rarity of the sort of double-coincidence that is required for this relationship to form is the very reason why human communities moved away from barter. Our localized economies reached a level of complexity that required the advent of representative money.

Eliminating the Double-Coincidence
----------------------------------
In the same way that our economies grew to become too complex for the barter system, our societies would become too complex to rely on every crucial social interaction having incentive for both participants. Just as the new form of currency relied on trust in the value of a coin, the more developed humans would trust their newfound skills in empathy and compassion to help them navigate their brave new world.

The power of the representative currency revealed itself with the massively expanding economies that it generated very rapidly. In the very same way, the skills of empathy and compassion that early humans would develop would come to develop these extrodinarliy complex communities.

The Community
-------------
The community, in itself, is what separates man from beast. The pack of wolves, troop of monkeys, or school of fish is similar, but only insofar as it is a collection of animals. The human community is complex to the point that it is incomparable to other intra-species groups.

Our communities are, however, comparable to entire ecosystems. The food chains and symbiotic relationships that find a place in the ecosystem are akin to the relationships that develop within a community.

However, this complexity is not a result of our vast technological developments, rather, it is the cause of them.

Consider being a human in the natural state. The only thing that you need to concern yourself with is finding food. You simply have no time to consider anything else. Now imagine being part of a community, where that specific job of finding food is delegated to a small subset of people. Those people are happy and willing to share their food with you, as long as you bring something else to the community. We have this sort of skill-based potluck to thank for our arts and sciences.

Have We Outdone Ourselves?
--------------------------
But what happens when a free-market economy continues on for an extended period of time? The massive stratification of wealth is not simply restricted to the economic system. The shortcut that humans developed with representative money can cause massive wealth, but also can cause massive poverty. The model of complex communities based on trust and empathy have created widespread happiness and improved the standard of living across the board, but have seemingly doomed the human race to an abrupt ending from one of any number of self-inflicted wounds: environmental disaster, nuclear war, or overpopulation. Society giveth, and society taketh away.

[^1]: Don't mistake me for a religious antagonist; I have many friends who have completely different views regarding the origin of life. These views satisfy them, and I have complete support for that. (It is also worth adding that the theories I consider more likely do not satisfy them, either.) While the tone of this sentence does not really reflect my actual opinions of intelligent design and creationism, I like it for its wit.
