I recently had a close friend confide that he felt unmotivated; He didn't truly feel in love with anything. No experiences or accomplishments or "success". Everything was just momentum and despite considerable external cues of heading in the "right" direction, everything was too easy and pointless. This got us talking about life, and classically - the existential issue of meaning. The inevitable counter-question was posed: What do I love and why? From where do I derive purpose and meaning?

It is perhaps first useful to say that when somebody doesn't feel in love with anything, they often have trouble investing in things. The loss of rejection or failure far outweighs - at that point - any conceivable gain, as the they don't really feel any sort of satisfaction from accomplishment. This sort of numbness is a vehicle for immobility. The hard part then, is getting to them to invest in the conversation. Ah yes, you see, if the person talking about their feelings of emptiness can't fill a dialogue, or invest in a discourse of beliefs, it is hard to convince them of much - much less learn of their current convictions.

The first step to realizing meaning is investing in yourself. Believing that you, inherently, have worth. This worth can be derived from different places. Some call it God's love, others that the possibility of their life is miraculous. I contend that worth is derived from our ability to think about it. Not simply "cogito ergo sum", but moreover that your ability to rationally compare the possibilities, to imagine this life and your role in it are devoid of purpose - this fact introduces the space required for meaning. The ability to reflect abstractly is the greatest faculty.

The second step is realizing that your choice to live is not contingent on the nature of the afterlife, the nature of the universe or the nature of being. Your choice to live is not contingent on any truth but that which you perceive. Your choice to live is grounded in your love - your ability to evaluate possibilies and reflect and choose. And your choice to live would not change were it all an illusion.

It is investing in things that we provide the meaning, because we, upon achieving, we can remember the time at which we desired to accomplish. It is the possibility of failure that provides meaning to success. It is reasonable doubt that provides meaning to certainty; Suffering that fills happiness; Rejection that fills acceptance; Death that fills life. Your ability to imagine any of these two possibilities, your faculty to choose is where I see meaning.

So what do I love? I love building upon the human experience. I think it is charecerized by a will to survive, a will for community and a will for progress and posterity. And the word progress only has any meaning so long we can compare. So I want to build around this, to allow humans to explore and grow together, and grow in a love of life and a relationship to life, to God, to the universe, because the worthy individual deserves no less. These compounding motivations result in a human experience characterized by love and trust and faith, by generosity and struggle and hope, by tragedy and beauty.

I believe continuing, fully aware of the possibility of tragedy, is the beauty that reflects one's love. I believe that in  accepting suffering we introduce the possibility happiness.Third then, is to exercise your ability to compare.
