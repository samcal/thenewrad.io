For the past few months, while in limbo between the dog days of high school and the stark pseudo-reality of college, I've been working with [Zeal](http://www.zeal.com/), a startup that works to create useful problem sets for grade school kids on a per-student basis; all while being managed and observed by their teachers. I maintained and developed the Android app. This is what my average day was like:

1. Wake up, push a release if I had forgotten the previous night.
2. Show up to the office around 10:00 AM, check my emails, and try to find new bugs.
3. Get e-mails about all of the bugs that the team finds.
4. Have a full-team meeting for ~5 minutes, where I voice which bugs I am going to fix.
5. Fix the bugs, find some new ones, and fix those.
6. Add some new features to the app.
7. Release the latest version of the app (If I remember, which wasn't often...)

This is essentially my entire job description. I was supposed to fix bugs, and add new features ad infinitum, which is fine because that's all that programming really is.

There were always bugs to fix and features to add
-------------------------------------------------

This is most of the reason that I "forgot" to release everyday. There was always some major bug that I had to fix, or some great new feature that all of the users would want to use. Whatever work went out the door with my stamp of approval on it, ultimately was my responsibility, and my bad if it was imperfect. Since it was in a state of perpetual imperfection, it couldn't possibly go out the door.

This was the wrong way to look at this situation.

I was thinking of a release as if it were only time for my colleagues to look at my work and judge me on my performance. This is true, to an extent, it was something that did indeed happen with every release.

The problem was that I was in a state of perpetual imperfection (which is the state of most things), to which I didn't really want show to my coworkers. All of the bug fixes seemed to create new bugs of their own, as did the new features that I added. It was an uphill battle from the start.

What I forgot
-------------

There is a very important set of people that were using my app that couldn't care less about the tiny imperfections, or the memory crashes that happen when you answer a hundred or so questions in a few seconds. The 500 or so students that were using my app daily ended up getting stuck a few versions behind, without many updates for new versions that added cool features like chatting with a teacher, or pagination of long lessons. I denied them the ability to use these features because I was not satisfied with my solution.

Douglas Hofstadter mentions this idea of "jumping out of the system" several times in his essay *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach* to describe the difference between a mind and a machine. In becoming more and more mechanical as the summer went on, I became more likely to forget to step out of the system that had been created for me.

The same will happen now that we are in college, I believe. It is easy to get caught up in grades, and the routine of day-to-day life. It is important to remember to jump out of that system, and to remember that there will come a time when we are no longer in school, and (not too long after), no one will care what your grades were. Go fry that bigger fish.
