I think an underlining problem of the next 20 years is going to be scalability, namely how systems, infrastructure, facilities and societies scale up. Computer systems face this issue today: social networks like twitter and facebook need to handle hundreds of millions of users. What works with you have 1000, or 10,000 doesn't work when you have 1 billion. Why this is true is a discussion for a nother article, but I will for now assume that it doesn't.

I am currently enrolled in an Anthropology of Global Health course. We discuss topics of the developing world especially regarding health care and with a focus on what we (generally speaking the developed world) can do about the current state of affairs. We also discuss what factors led to suffering such as the AIDs and turboculosis crises in Haiti (spoiler: imperialism and slavery). What I find to be one of the more troubling, and less dealt with topics is the issues of what terms the developing and developed world.

You see, when we talk about the developing world in reference to the developed world we imply that everyone is trying to catch up to us. That we want the developing world to become developed, and well, that we are developed. I think this is a gross oversight.

If the entire subcontinent of India started living like we do today it would be an environmental catastrophe[^1]. The developing world can't catch up to the developed world because the developed world is doesn't have it figured out. We haven't solved a lot of the big issues, namely health care.

When we study medical antrhopolgy there is a lot of self-loathing and complaining on the parts of antrhopologists about the inefficacy of the health programs. In the recent Ebola outbreaks people criticzed the WHO as it effectively declared the crisis over prior the the largest and most deadly outbreak(todo: add citations). What bothers me is that we think that the developed world knows how to handle such crises.

To drive this point home I am going to give you a thought experiment. Imagine that you could teleport everybody affected with AIDs, turboculosis and malaria to every institutionalized brick-and-mortar western hospital anywhere. You could teleport them, just like that.

You still wouldn't solve the crisis!

Our hospitals couln't handle the load, and even if they could it wouldn't be effective. I just gave you a magical power, I said you can fricken teleport people and guess what, we still have a health care crisis. Heck, documentaries like Danka document the awful state of health care in Africa, what about documentaries like Sicko that document the awful state of health care in US.


We need to figure out our situation first. Because our modern western health care doesn't scale. I'm saying it's great if you can solve a problem. And if only ten people have that problem then that's great too. But I'm also saying that even if you have a solution, you dare not call yourself developed until you can scale up. You see systems, whether the computer servers and databases of twitter and facebook, or the hospitals and preventative care of an entire nation, _need to scale_. It isn't enough to solve for n = 1, or n = 10, or n = 100,000. You need to scale for n = 1,000,0000. Or, n = 7,300,000 [^2].
