### Developing

I believe that the problem of scalability will underscore the next 20 years. I regard scalability to be the property by which systems, infrastructure, facilities and societies serve the exponentially growing human population. Computer systems face this issue today: social networks like twitter and facebook need to handle hundreds of millions of users. And architects of these systems are learning that what works for a thousand, or ten thousand users doesn't world when you have one billion users. The fundamental existence of the issues of scalability is another discussion, for now let's assume that this problem exists.

I am currently enrolled in an Anthropology of Global Health course. We discuss the developing world's health care focusing on what we (generally speaking, the developed world) can do about the current issues and flaws in global health [^1]. We also discuss the factors contributing to the biosocial suffering and structural violence in countries such as Haiti [^2]. But what I find to be one of the more troubling, and least discusses issues, is the existence of the notions "developing" and "developed."

When we discuss the "developing" world, we implicitly reference a "developed" world. We imply that everyone is trying to catch up to us. We imply that the goal is for the developing world to become developed. Worst yet, we imply that we are, well, developed. This implication is a gross oversight.

### "Developed"

If the entire subcontinent of India started living like we do today it would be an environmental catastrophe [^3]. The developing world can not catch up to the developed world because the developed world is does not have society figured out. Unless the entire developed world can agree that we are without problem the "developing" world should not _want_ to catch up. Some argue that the developed world is a better state than that experienced by the developing. I would argue that in the current equilibrium, this is true, but that we have yet to solve a lot of the big issues. I would argue that the developed world is in an unstable equilibrium and is not equipped to handle the chaos external to it, as evinced by the struggles of humanitarianism.

In reading about medical anthropology I encounter a great degree of self-loathing and complaining specifically regarding the inefficacy of the western, "developed," health programs in the "developing" world. Anthropologists criticized the WHO regarding the WHO's misassessment that the crisis was effectively over prior to most severe outbreak (todo: add citations). It bothers me is that the "developed" world thinks that it knows how to handle such crises.

The following thought experiment motivated this article.

Imagine that you could teleport everybody affected with AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to every institutionalized brick-and-mortar western hospital anywhere. You could teleport them, just like that.

You still wouldn't solve the health crisis!

Our hospitals couldn't handle the load. I just gave you a magical power, I said you can fricken teleport people and guess what, we still have a health care crisis. Documentaries like Danka document the awful state of health care in Africa, what about documentaries like Sicko that document the awful state of health care in US.


We need to figure out our situation first. Because our modern western health care doesn't scale. It's great if you can solve a problem. And if only ten people have that problem then that's great too. But even if you have a solution, you dare not call it "developed" until you can scale up. Systems, whether the servers and databases of twitter and facebook, or the hospitals and preventative care of an entire nation, _need to scale_. It isn't enough to solve for n = 1, or n = 10, or n = 100,000. You need to solve for n = 1,000,0000. Because as of this writing, n = 7,300,000 [^4].
