# A Systematic World

The the systems which compose our world seem organic and continuous. Systems such as our public schools, our higher education, our health care, our government, our jobs. Systems like the economy, airline traffic, weather.

Everything is a system of some sort, and systems are composed of objects that act in parallel. No wonder, then, that we manage models of the world in systems programming using concurrency and object-oriented design.

# Why?

We tend towards these pre-determined, often familiar paradigms. We tend towards normalcy; a regression to the mean, a complacency that manifests as the grip of mediocrity. Breaking outside of the system, breaking a mode of thought, especially a status quo reinforced by the surrounding environment is difficult. Consistency is such a huge component of a structured, manageable schedule. Consistency simplifies.

[Though we should remember to jump outside these systems](http://thenewrad.io/samcal/2014/10/08/jump-out-of-the-system.html). Humans have the ability of self-reflection, the ability to step outside of the system. The ability to analyze, observe and critique the systems we live in, to understand the human condition. It is acting on our ability to do so that is intelligence [^1].


# Artificial Intelligence

Imagine now,  a specific system: the archetypal, ultimate artificial intelligence. A machine with the ability to expand it's knowledge, a machine with the capacity for structured thought. A machine or program, that accrued information and acted on informed decisions [^2]. A system that maximized its growth of knowledge and power and optimized its abilities.

If humanity ever did create such artificial intelligence it would be unforgivably short-sighted not to dictate human life as one of the variables to be optimized. To build AI without explicitly providing for the human condition, without awareness or understanding of our species, would be to build again (unfortunately not for the first time), a tool whose purpose would be misaligned with human existence, human values, and the human experience.

# My Goal

I want to build systems that incorporate aspects of artificial intelligence, at least aspects of machine learning, and leverage the permeation of technology and instrumentation throughout our lives to improve the human experience and propel the progress of community. A project for which we only have the beginnings: [elos](github.com/elos).

Unsurprisingly, people often express discomfort at the idea of a computer system managing, and "deciding," for them. They shy from the idea that a system, a perpetuator of misaligned, hyperbolized, perspectivistic values and goals, could ever accurately inform a meaningful human decision.

And rightly so: their uneasiness is not unfounded. For if we built a system without the human component, without the space for human expression, without the scope of human influence, we should destroy it.

With elos, we hope to design for the human component, to build in the possibility and opportunity and desire to step outside of the system. To ask our _human_ users about their beliefs and values and goals - both distant and pressing.

We aspire to build a system that begs not the question of whether we like where we are, but instead raises the question of whether we like where humanity is going. We believe that such a point could nowhere else be better contested that in the individual's life.

What a time to believe both in humanity and progress. What a time to articulate, challenge, confront and leap outside of the systems we live in. The systems we construct for ourselves.
