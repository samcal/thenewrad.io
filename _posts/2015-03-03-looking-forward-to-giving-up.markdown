You pulled an all nighter on thurday for the test on friday. The dorm party next door kept you from getting a wink of sleep friday night. You promised to do a fundraiser at 7 am on saturday. You deserved a relaxing tv afternoon on saturday, and if you're not social on saturday night then people get offended. Sunday morning 9 am service your working childrens ministries then you go the regular service and of course out to lunch with your fellow church goers. You desperately need a nap. Then some dinner. And now its 7 pm on sunday night. You are beat, and yet to have started on your homework. 70 pages of reading for theology, an hour or two of calculus, reading quiz in physics tomorrow, and you promised your friend/mother/father/sister/brother that you would check out that this or write up that that. So your tired from not sleeping, feeling guilty for letting someone down, and hopeless about the prospect of getting things done in a way that will launch your week off right. Fatigue, guilt, and worry are not the best mindsets to have when approaching a formidable set of tasks. Relax, take a deap breath. It's not that bad, just compose yourself. That's the most important thing right now. Block out the fatigue, forget about the guilt, let the worry melt away. Pull up your newsfeed and see, Sabrina Kinney liked a buzzfeed article about "the top 15 ways that ryan gosling would propose to you", should be a good read...ooo what about closetclicks, any new users, wonder where this girl is from, are we going viral? better check analytics...I just need to break from the action and recoup, one 20 min episode of the office to let my mind free up and I'll be back at it. Great, it's 10pm; I'm done, all the consistent hard work of the last 3 weeks and I just threw it all away. I'm officially behind, and I'm not in any position to catch up. Bad mindset, I need to rev up, clear my head, get back on track...20 minute nap and I'll be refreshed and ready to go...
