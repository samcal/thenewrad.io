# The New Rad(.io)

How do you get your information? Do you read blogs? Watch the news? Do you read for quality, or to agree? Why are you here? Engagement or distraction?

*I refuse to be your distraction.*

Let's agree on one thing; erh, two things. First, call me lando, after all it is my *Nick* name. Second, when you visit thenewrad.io, come for growth, exploration, exposure to new and exciting new ideas. You do not read for the sake of reading. You read with intention. You act with intention. 

### Radio

In many ways, the radio _was_ what the internet today. Communication became easier. News spread faster. Culture (music) spread. And so several generations matured with the constant sound of the radio in the background. The radio in the car. The radio in the house. Radio for the sake of radio. Radio as white noise. 

Today, the television is white noise. People keep it on in the background. It is on in restaurants. The football game in the background, the news a constant murmur. 

### This is The New Radio and we are The New Rad.

Actually, you are the new rad. By reading this blog, you fundamentally support change. You support us. You support information for the sake of learning. You support engagement. You support a call to action. You support an internet for the benefit of all and the process of siphoning out the best information from the worst. You believe in quality over quantity. You believe in the best. In this end, you are a minimalist. Is your room spartan, your desk bare? - no. But you search out only the best sources of information and the best providers of those sources. You search for a new radio. A filtered radio. Not censored, but filtered. Filtered for junk, filtered for miscellaneous shit. Not a constant murmur, but a shout - every once and a while. 

### And

So. So I promise to write _for_ the sake of writing.

I care about experiences. I care about the moments that bring joy to my life, that excite me for the sunrise. I am passionate about creating value in my own life and this drive translates into my love of creating better experiences for others.
In my life: I want more creating, more books, more long walks. More laughter and road trips, more dreaming and music. 

And I want it in yours too. After all, I want more stories to tell, and more experiences to share.
