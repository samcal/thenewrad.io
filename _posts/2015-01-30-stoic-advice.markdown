[Royce's post on his experience with _Thinking Fast and Slow_](http://thenewrad.io/rbfasho/2015/01/26/reading-fast-and-slow.html) mentioned the idea
of putting oneself in discomfort in order to improve oneself. This idea reminded
me of other ideas by Stoic philosophers, summarized in this passage by William
B. Irvine, a modern Stoic writer and historian:

> We should periodically cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could
> easily have avoided. We might accomplish this by underdressing for cold
> weather or going shoeless. Or we might periodically allow ourselves to become
> thirsty or hungry, even though water and food are at hand, and we might sleep
> on a hard bed, even though a soft one is available.
>
> Many modern readers, on hearing this, will conclude that Stoicism involves an
> element of masochism. Readers should realize, though, that Stoics didn't go
> around flogging themselves. Indeed, the discomforts they inflicted upon
> themselves were rather minor. Furthermore, they did not inflict these
> discomforts to punish themselves; rather, they did it to increase their
> enjoyment of life. And finally, it is misleading to talk about the Stoics
> *inflicting* discomforts on themselves. This creates the image of someone at
> odds with himself, of someone forcing himself to do things he doesn't want to
> do. The Stoics, by way of contrast, *welcomed* a degree of discomfort in their
> life. What the Stoics were advocating, then, is more appropriately described
> as a program of voluntary discomfort than as a program of self-inflicted
> discomfort.
>
> Even this clarification of the Stoics' attitude toward discomfort, though,
> will leave many modern readers puzzled: "Why should we welcome even minor
> discomforts when it is possible to enjoy perfect comfort?" they will ask. In
> response to this question, Musonius would point to three benefits to be
> derived from acts of voluntary discomfort.
>
> To begin with, by undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort -- by, for example,
> choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well-fed -- we harden
> ourselves against misfortune that might befall us in the future. If all we
> know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience
> pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will. In other words,
> voluntary discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing
> ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an
> immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future.
> Alternatively, voluntary discomfort can be thought of as an insurance premium
> which, if paid, makes us eligible for benefits: Should we later fall victim to
> a misfortune, the discomfort we experience then will be substantially less
> than it otherwise would have been.
>
> A second benefit of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort comes not in the
> future but immediately. A person who periodically experiences minor
> discomforts will grow confident that he can withstand major discomforts as
> well, so the prospect of experiencing such discomforts at some future time
> will not, at present, be a source of anxiety for him. By experiencing minor
> discomforts, he is, says Musonius, training himself to be courageous. The
> person who, in contrast, is a stranger to discomfort, who has never been cold
> or hungry, might dread the possibility of someday being cold and hungry. Even
> though he is now physically comfortable, he will likely experience mental
> discomfort -- namely, anxiety with respect to what the future holds in store
> for him.
>
> A third benefit of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort is that it helps
> us appreciate what we already have. In particular, by purposely causing
> ourselves discomfort, we will better appreciate whatever comfort we
> experience. It is, of course, nice to be in a warm room when it is cold and
> blustery outside, but if we really want to enjoy that warmth and sense of
> shelter, we should go outside in the cold for a while and then come back in.
> Likewise, we can (as Diogenes observed) greatly enhance out appreciation of
> any meal by waiting until we are hungry before we eat it and greatly enhance
> our appreciation of any beverage by waiting until we are thirsty before we
> drink it.
