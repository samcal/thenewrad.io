Mind and Body Connection
------------------------

Imagine biting into a lemon. It is sour. Can you feel your lips curl back? You bite a bit further and the some of the juice puddles in the back of your mouth. You are thinking about biting into a lemon, yes.

And most likely you are also salivating.

If so, you've encountered a simple affirmation of the connection between your mind and body. The thought of biting the lemon causes salivation. The notion of such a connection may seem obvious, as modern culture accepts so much.

I encourage you to take this enlightenment a step further. Understand that your thoughts have physical manifestations. (Another commonly invoked example is sexuality)

Ladybugs
--------

Now let's imagine that you are generally comfortable in the outdoors, but one day while walking with friends a ladybug lands on your arm. Startled, you jump back. Your friends laugh, and poke fun at your "fear" of ladybugs. Such a fear is seemingly innocuous and ungrounded, but imagine for a moment that you are repulsed by such a fear. Imagine that such a fear is in direct conflict with your appreciation of the wilderness. Imagine, that you are scared of the possibility that you could be scared of a ladybug.

You understand fear. You know that fear causes the hair on your neck to prick up. Your palms sweat only slightly more than usual. You feel goosebumps. Your back chills as you get the feeling something is behind you.

The next time you see a ladybug, you test yourself:

"Do I have goosebumps?

How sweaty are my palms?

Is my hair on end?

Is that a breeze?"

You check these vital signs when you see the ladybug. And though a ladybug never so much bothered you before, suddenly you suppose that maybe your palms are a bit sweatier than normal. In fact, maybe you are scared of ladybugs but your conception of yourself as an outdoorsman previously suppresed that inner self.

Maybe, inherently you have a fear of ladybugs, however irrational - however "unnatural" - however in conflict with your previously conceived notion of self.

Defining the Manifestation of Fear
---------------------------------

While the ladybug crawled around on the oak bench, you felt the symptoms of fear. They were manifestations of you checking yourself. The possibility of fear, and the abstract definition and mental picture of what that fear manifested physically. Remember biting a lemon?

So, did you really feel afraid?

It would seem so. The physical manifestation and symptoms of fear while near a ladybug is analogous to the fear of the ladybug itself.

While you question whether your essential self is scared of ladybugs, you forget about the connection between mind and body. And you forget that the test was unfair.

In fact you forget that your foundational litmus test is a trap of conflation, and that your experiences in that moment are contrived. To draw connections between internal source of feeling and external conditions is a fallacy. But now you can't be sure. And now, as you think of ladybugs, your fear grows. You mentally test whether you are afraid, you build false experiences, thinking back to that first flawed sscenario as proof of a fear. A fear, mind you, that did not exist previously. A fear, that was conflated.

The idea of a physical response produced that response. And the trigger, a ladybug, becomes an archetypal perversion of cause and effect, and of fear.

This perversion of fear fuels psychological unrest and irrationality.

OCD
---

Obsessive compulsive disorder is today an umbrella term for the modern perfectionist. Therefore I necesesarily define it:  compulsive (recurring) fears which debilitate action and/or affect behavior.

The turmoil of OCD is that fear can manifest while worrying about the fear. And this conflation seemingly produces evidence that the fear may not be unfounded. That the thought was not an obsessive fear, but rather a product of one's inherent being.

The crisis of identity that results is the bane of the obsessively compulsive person.

Depression
----------

Depression is likewise related to this perversion of fear. Society today emphasizes happiness, and shies from the possibility of sadness.

Therefore a fear of being sad exists. This fear can manifest itself though, as sadness. The debilitation of the meloncholic is her or his evaluation of each happening as producing either good or bad emotion.

It is in testing for sadness that meloncholy grows. The thought produces the feeling, and conflates with the events in question.  The fear of negativity grows by asking about it repeatedly, and grows with the accumulation of falacious conflations[^1]. The fear prevents recovery.

Homophobia
----------

I take homophobia as another fear common to society today. It too is a manifestation of this perversion of fear

In accepting the existence or possibility of homosexuality, one must also accept the option as a possiblity of one's own sexual orientation.

Society (and especially its conceptions of masculinity) pressures against homosexuality. Subsequently one may fear one's true sexual orientation be homosexual.

This fear produces homophobia and fuels those who argue that homosexuality does not actually exist - as it could then not possibly threaten one's identity[^2].

The presence of fear removes the possibility of an unbiased, rational impression, especially as the presence of fear can produce unsettling feelings.

Sickness as a State of Mind
---------------------------

The presence of fear can manifest physically. A fearful mind is irrational, and subject to fallacy.

The perversion of fear produces psychological unrest and pollutes identity.

In this way, I view fear and its perversion as a threat. I fear it. Though by recognizing it, perhaps I can overcome any obstacles it may present to my clarity of thought.
