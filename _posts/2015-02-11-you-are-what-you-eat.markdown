I'd say I sleep around 7 1/2 hours a day on average. So on my typical day I'm up from about 7:45 am until 12:15. I have the potentiality for concious thought for 16 1/2 hours. And those 16 1/2 hours are responsible for shaping who I am, on a day to day basis.

The moment I wake up I am recieving input. Senses are feeding data to my mind. When I see it, I don't have the opportunity to say whether or not I think about it. That's automatic. And theres 16 1/2 hours that I'm working with The choices I have revolve around putting myself in positions to recieve positive and negative data. Which I will then be thinking about.

So what TV do you watch? What music do you listen to? That will not only tell you something about who you are, but also who you are becoming. No matter how much you trust youself to be able siphon out the bad and take in the good, if you hang out with the wrong crowd enough, or feeding your mind with ludicrous song lyrics for enough hours, it will change you. Garbage in, garbage out. What you see, what you eat, what you think matters. Who you are matters.


"The present is the point at which time touches eternity" - C.S. Lewis

The present plays an interesting role in life. I like to think of the depth of a moment as synonymous with a singularity that starts a black hole. At a single instant the past present and future meet to produce what we know of existence. That's my interpretation of C.S. Lewis' definition of the present. Where you have been and where you are going are part of who you are. So if its reflecting on the past or preparing for the future, both define the present you. 

There are activities that give energy and ones that take it away. When I'm studying, taking a break to play video games makes it very hard for me to return to doing work afterwards whereas reading a book allows me to rest my mind from focusing on one subject and also keeps it warm for when I get back at it. The same goes for watching television, it doesn't rejuvinate, it takes the mind into a state of dependency. Activity is paused and it becomes purely a bystander. Television and video games are good for a lot of people in a lot of ways, they don't belong in what I'll call my "workdsay" which is really any period of time in which I wish to use my mind to be productive.
