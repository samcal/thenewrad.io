I'd say I sleep around 7 1/2 hours a day on average. So on my typical day I'm up from about 7:45 am until 12:15. I have the potentiality for concious thought for 16 1/2 hours. And those 16 1/2 hours are responsible for shaping who I am, on a day to day basis.

The moment I wake up I am recieving input. Senses are feeding data to my mind. When I see it, I don't have the opportunity to say whether or not I think about it. That's automatic. Thats not how it works. The choices I have revolve around putting myself in positions to recieve positive and negative data.

There are activities that give energy and ones that take it away. When I'm studying, taking a break to play video games makes it very hard for me to return to doing work afterwards whereas reading a book allows me to rest my mind from focusing on one subject and also keeps it warm for when I get back at it. The same goes for watching television, it doesn't rejuvinate, it takes the mind into a state of dependency. Activity is paused and it becomes purely a bystander. Television and video games are good for a lot of people in a lot of ways, they don't belong in what I'll call my "workdsay" which is really any period of time in which I wish to use my mind to be productive.
