A few weeks back I wrote a lengthy, pedantic, and extra-ordinarily dense article on interface. It felt right to start from the technical because it was computer science and computer systems architecture that instructed me power in the power abstraction and interfaces. Sadly, I lost the lost sight of the my original goal: to demonstrate how abstraction and interfaces are used in systems design everywhere, and to argue that the better the abstraction the stronger, more resilient, and more useful the system. I attempt to to that here.
