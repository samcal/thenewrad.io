A friend of mine recently told me of a technical interview question that he was
asked when he applied for a job at Facebook. It was an implementation
of [Regular Expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), with
a very simplified alphabet. The characters will be:

* `a-z`, which matches that character
* `.`, which matches any character
* `*`, which matches 0 or more occurances of the preceding character

We're going to write a solution in Haskell.

Our function `match` will take 2 `String`s, a pattern and a string to be
matched, and will return a boolean. In Haskell, we write that type declaration
as follows:

{% highlight haskell %}
match :: String -> String -> Bool
{% endhighlight %}

The first `String` is a pattern, the second is a `String` to be matched, the `Bool`
is what we return.

We will be defining this function recursively, so a good place to start is with
some base conditions. These are simple conditions that will always hold true:

{% highlight haskell %}
match :: String -> String -> Bool
match [] [] = True
match [] _  = False
{% endhighlight %}

Woah, woah, woah, this is super weird. To understand this, we need some
background information.

A `String` is just a list of `Char`s. In Haskell, we write this as:
{% highlight haskell %}
typealias String = [Char]
{% endhighlight %}

And function application happens very similarly to bash, with spaces in between
arguments:

{% highlight haskell %}
f x y --- equivalent to f(x, y) in other languages
{% endhighlight %}

So with this code:
{% highlight haskell %}
match :: String -> String -> Bool
match [] [] = True
match [] _  = False
{% endhighlight %}
we say that we will return `True` if the pattern and string are both empty, and
`False` if the pattern is empty, but the string is not.

Now what if the string is empty, but the pattern isn't? That is a little more
complicated, because with the pesky `*`, we can still match that string. The
following code will do the trick:

{% highlight haskell %}
match pattern [] =
  case pattern of
    (_:'*':restOfPattern) -> match restOfPattern []
    _ -> False
{% endhighlight %}

This piece of code matches a non-empty pattern with an empty string. Then, using
a `case...of` statement, we pattern-match according to the contents of the
pattern string. If the pattern is a `Char`, followed by an `*`, then we pop off
those `Char`s and recheck. Otherwise, the pattern must not match, and we return
`False`.

[Pattern Matching](http://learnyouahaskell.com/syntax-in-functions) does all of
the magic behind this. The expression `(_:'*':restOfPattern)` matches a `String`
with any first `Char`, followed by an `*`, and binds the rest of the `String` to
the variable `restOfPattern`.

Alright! Now let's implement the part of the function that will do the most
legwork, the recursion that matches character-to-character. It looks like this:

{% highlight haskell %}
match (firstOfPattern:restOfPattern) (firstOfString:restOfString)
  | firstOfPattern == '.' = match restOfPattern restOfString
  | firstOfPattern == firstOfString = match restOfPattern restOfString
  | otherwise = False
{% endhighlight %}

With our two `String` inputs, we pop the first `Char` off of the `String`. If
the first of the pattern is a `.`, then we check for a match for the rest of the
`String`. We do the same if the first `Char` of the pattern and string are the
same. Otherwise, the pattern does not match and we return `False`.

OK, so what do we have so far? We have a function that can compare two
`String`s, and we can replace `.`s for letters in the pattern `String` and it
will still match the proper given string.

Next, let's implement the functionality for `*`. Let's start in the same way,
popping off the first character of both the pattern and the string, pattern
matching so that the `*` will be in the right place for this logic. Upon
comparison between the first letters, there are two outcomes:

1. The first letters match, so we pop one letter off of the string (not the
   pattern) and recheck.
2. The first letters do not match, and we pop the letter and `*` off of the
   pattern (not the string) and recheck.

The logic looks like this in Haskell:

{% highlight haskell %}
match pattern@(firstOfPattern:'*':restOfPattern) s@(firstOfString:restOfString)
  | firstOfPattern == firstOfString = match pattern restOfString
  | otherwise = match restOfPattern s
{% endhighlight %}

Ok, so now we have an operator, `*` that will allow a pattern to have a feature
where the preceding character can be repeated 0 or more times. We're almost
finished! We just need one more case: the `.*` sequence in the pattern, which
matches any character sequence, or no characters at all. The tricky part about
this is that we can't just continue popping characters off, simply because we
won't get to the end of the pattern, and we will return `False` based off of
our base conditions! So, when we come across a `.*`, we need to check the rest
of the pattern and string for a match, just in case it is time to stop matching
with the `.*`. When we come across a `.*`, there are two options again:

1. The rest of the pattern matches the string, and we return `True`.
2. Otherwise, we pop a character off of the string, and recheck. We can do this
   because everything will match `.*`.

The logic looks like this in Haskell:

{% highlight haskell %}
match pattern@('.':'*':restOfPattern) s@(firstOfString:restOfString)
  | match restOfPattern s = True
  | otherwise = match pattern restOfString
{% endhighlight %}

And we're done! We have a fully-functional simplified regex matcher. The entire
code looks like this:

{% highlight haskell %}
match :: String -> String -> Bool
match [] [] = True
match [] _  = False
match pattern [] =
  case pattern of
    (_:'*':restOfPattern) -> match restOfPattern []
    _ -> False

match pattern@('.':'*':restOfPattern) s@(firstOfString:restOfString)
  | match restOfPattern s = True
  | otherwise = match pattern restOfString

match pattern@(firstOfPattern:'*':restOfPattern) s@(firstOfString:restOfString)
  | firstOfPattern == firstOfString = match pattern restOfString
  | otherwise = match restOfPattern s

match (firstOfPattern:restOfPattern) (firstOfString:restOfString)
  | firstOfPattern == '.' = match restOfPattern restOfString
  | firstOfPattern == firstOfString = match restOfPattern restOfString
  | otherwise = False
{% endhighlight %}

The order of declarations is important, as Haskell will pattern-match in order,
so we need to define the `.*` case before the regular `*` case, because we don't
the latter would still pattern-match the former.

Recursion is a very powerful way to simplify problems, and Haskell is a very
elegant way to implement a recursive solution to a problem.
