As you saw this past Sunday, Pete Carrol, head coach of the seattle seahawks, called a passing play on the 1-yard line with time winding down and the superbowl on the line. The pass was intercepted, and what one moment looked like near certain victory turned to defeat for his team. 

Systems are really nice. They provide a road map for a certain input to become a desired output. You want some C's? Well just plug some B's into the system and we can churn out some C's for you. Systems are great. As long as you have B's. Human systems are tough when you aren't quite a B and your don't particularly want to be a C, but at the same time you like a lot of the characteristics the C's have and would like to use the tools that the system uses to get from B's to C's. The other name that I was thinking of giving this article was "Learning how to hack: Disrupting Human Systems" because the way I like to think of hacking is tinkering with the assets of a system in order to create something uniquely personal. Building on the shoulder of the systems that already exist, except sort of messing up all of the pieces that make it up. I think that every person learns how to hack sooner or later. But learning how to hack is a skill, and I think the first key is mastery of the pre-existing system. 

I'll talk about basektball to try and illustrate how mastery allows one the ability to hack. When a child is learning the fundamentals of how to dribble and shoot, they clearly won't have the ability to maximize their physical capabilites or read a defenders feet in order to apply an offensive move. All the child learning how to dribble is worried about is keeping the ball inbetween his hand and the ground. But once he masters this skill, once the ball is a part of his hand, he can start hacking. He can work within the system (the rules of the game) in a unique way that is advantageous to his personal athelticism or skills. Basically, you need to master the tools in order to tinker with the system. And this is the way hacking is supposed to be done. An awareness of the system, accompanied by a mastery of the tools used in the system, with an additional self-awareness that allows one to know that their are unique ways in which they differ as an individual from the archetype the system is built for. 

I like to think that good professors have a system in mind for the classes they are teaching. A pathway that they envision a good student will follow which leads them to success in the class. Take my physics class for instance. Monday morning at 8am an online reading quiz is due, in which students are supposed to read the textbook sections that will be discussed in lecture for the coming week. With this rough understanding of the concepts lectures are able to dive more deeply into the topics as they should be the second time that similiar information is being presented. A problem set covering the topics for the week is due on wednesday morning so that students are pushed to apply content. Finally, the online homework system generates a review of the topics due on friday along with the class lecture that reviews the content and bridges it forward to the next week. 

If we zoom out a little more, the system of this physics class is operating on the premise that the pace of content and repitition is sufficient given that most kids in the class should be operating at around the same
