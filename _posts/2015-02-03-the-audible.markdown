As you saw this past Sunday, Pete Carrol, head coach of the seattle seahawks, called a passing play on the 1-yard line with time winding down and the superbowl on the line. The pass was intercepted, and what one moment looked like near certain victory turned to defeat for his team. 

Systems are really nice. They provide a road map for a certain input to become a desired output. You want some B's? Well just plug 'em into the system and we can churn out some C's for you. Systems are great. As long as you have B's. Human systems are tough when you aren't quite a B and your don't particularly want to be a C, but you like a lot of the characteristics the C's have and would like to use the tools that the system uses to get from B's to C's. The other name that I was thinking of giving this article was "Learning how to hack: Disrupting Human Systems" because the way I like to think of hacking is tinkering with the assets of a system in order to create something uniquely personal. Building on the shoulder of the systems that already exist, except sort of messing up all of the pieces that make it up. I think that every person learns how to hack sooner or later. But learning how to hack is a skill, and I think the first key is mastery of the pre-existing system.
