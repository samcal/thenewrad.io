But learning how to hack is a skill, and I think the first key is mastery of the pre-existing system. 

I like to think that good professors have a system in mind for the classes they are teaching. A pathway that they envision a good student will follow which leads them to success in the class. Take my physics class for instance. Monday morning at 8am an online reading quiz is due, in which students are supposed to read the textbook sections that will be discussed in lecture for the coming week. With this rough understanding of the concepts lectures are able to dive more deeply into the topics as they should be the second time that similiar information is being presented. A problem set covering the topics for the week is due on wednesday morning so that students are pushed to apply content. Finally, the online homework system generates
