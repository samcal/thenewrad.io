# Seeing is important, but not nearly half the battle

Everybody wants to improve. All people are in search of something; some attribute of themselves, some component of their surroundings, something better than their current condition. And this is, as it should be - everyone sees the potential for improvement.

Why not, then, does everyone act? Why are so many people stuck in limbo? Feeling as though they can never achieve that which they so much desire.

## I believe two things. 
1. People are scared of trying, because they are scared of failing.
2. People don’t really want it.

# Fearsome Failure
The fear of failure is the single most important thing that I have ever realized to be hindering my action. I strongly believe that at the root of all my procrastination is the notion that if I spend more time or think about it for a little bit longer that, then, somehow, someway I will be better equipped or in a better state of mind or better able to handle whatever it is that I need to do. This covers everything from the spanish homework which I know I won’t understand the first 2-3 times through, to the design that I really want to create for that one project. 

So, the question becomes how do you become productive, by getting past this fear? Well, It would seem that you must remove the deadline, you must remove all chance of you failing. That by making it a zero stakes game you will do it. But then, the question becomes, will you really do it? Will you? Have you ever worked without a deadline? Yes? Most likely the first few weeks (months) was probably fantastic. You probably made a lot of progress.

But.

You also probably plateaued. Most likely you never finished whatever it was that you set out to do. Only a deadline can force you to finish. And when we are in the business of playing to win, we need every finish, ever close, every little win, however small, that we can get.

# Comfortable Complacence
Complacence is that feeling that you might as well eat that candy bar because you really aren’t that fat anyways. That you do have a little bit of chub on your abs but that really, you aren’t obese and so therefore: why worry about it? Complacence is the idea that a B is “above average.” The notion that not every 16 year old kid starts a company, or has side projects, so why should you? Complacence is a snake. Duplicitous. Complacence is comfortable and intoxicating. Why go talk to that girl over there at the other table if I can continue to sit here, minding my own business, writing this article that I really like. Heck, I am more cultured than her so why bother. Ha, I am so cultured, sipping my chai tea latte and writing at the local cafe, I am fine - I don’t need to worry about a thing. 

Complacence is that Friday feeling…the one you love….the one where you go home, and do nothing.

So, how do you get past complacence. You have to get fed up with being average. 

You may wonder: what is average? I’ll tell you. **You** are average. Heck, I am average. But the difference (right now at least) between you and I is that I am doing everything in my power not to be average. I am trying as best as I can to get away from the baseline. Life is this (something right about the middle), and I like this (something a little closer to the top). But I can not make you feel as though you need to change. Heck you could be just fine the way you are. Complacence, after all, is comfortable, and if you like comfortable and feel no need to change, then comfortable you shall stay. 

But I have a feeling that your comfort is hollow, that you do not actually feel fulfilled. That sometimes you wish you could shed those pounds, read that book, learn about such and such or do so and so. This feeling is inherent. And it is this that you need to channel in order to catalyze your change. Once you start winning, you won’t look back.

So become fed up with average, truly get to the point where you want to change, and I bet you will get past the fear of failure, and the fear of failure, will become your best friend. And we will talk about that in the next post.
