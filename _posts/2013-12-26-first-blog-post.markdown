First impressions can be difficult, especially when they can be put off, as is the case in a context similar to the one I find myself in now. If someone like me wishes to put their thoughts out into the world, there is not (and should not be) any reason for the readers to share their ideas that conflict with mine, and possibly construct and share their opinions of myself personally. This is a lot of pressure for the writer, and has a tendency to be avoided if at all possible.

Such is the nature of new things. People (myself especially) can overcomplicate novelty by introducing a feeling of awkwardness. What should be a time filled with excitement ends up being a time of worry and insecurity. I don't want this to be like that.

There will be three contributors to this blog as of its inception.

**Nick Landolfi** is a bongo-drum prodigy and doppelganger of Mr. Darcy from *Pride and Prejudice*

**Royce Branning** is a basketball player and amateur jokester.

**Sam Calvert** is currently writing this, and is the normal one of the group.

  Adventure(trio).embark()
