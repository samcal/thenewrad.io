People run all the time. You’re probably used to running. You’ve probably taken off for first base, or kicked it into high gear to beat the bell, maybe even strided it out on a Saturday morning for some exercise.(Go you!) You can run for your life, run for office, run a business. Running is versatile. Running gives you options. The uninterested bystander see’s a jogger, the boy on the street sees speed. You’re running an errand or catching a bus, late for work or excited to greet a loved one. You’re a picture of the human species utilizing its most natural mode of transportation. But putting up your fists, that’s  a universal sign for ‘we have a problem’. A fundamental representation of the detereriation of the human community. You put your fists up because you and your fellow man have lost favor with one another to the point where you no longer regard each other’s well-being as worthwhile. You make a conscious decision that the brokenness that has transpired will bear more fruit. But you’re just going to do your part to right a wrong, right? If not he will. And if you don’t he won’t learn. And if you don’t he might make you learn. And this is how we teach. So go ahead, his are already up, and when someone holds a gun like that to your head you have to do what they say right? Wrong, you can do what your society and pride don’t want you to. You can make the decision that allows us to make it in the knick of time or be a second early to a loved ones embrace. You can run. 

For those of you that find themselves in a lot of fights and also write code (like me because I definitely do both of those things a lot):

{% highlight python %}

def in_a_fight(you, other_guy):
	if you.size >= other_guy.size:
		if you.have_empathy:
			you.run()
		else:
			you.fight()
	elif you.size < other_guy.size:
		if you.are_smart:
			you.run()
		else:
			you.fight()
{% endhighlight %}

*if you find an error in this code you can take it up with theup&cominghacker427 and see what happens*
**DO IT**
*I dare you*
