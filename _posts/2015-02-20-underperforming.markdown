I got my calc test back today. The original score of 88 was crossed out and it was an 82. They had caught a mistake on the second review that they had missed on the first. The 88 was the score I saw online. I was already a little dissapointed I hadn't gotten a 90. I don't like to talk about grades in such explicit terms usually but I think it serves to illustrate the point I'm going to be talking about. I was mad that I didn't get a 90, or even a 100 for that matter, because I felt I had put in the time. 

Over break I knew this class was going to be very challenging for me, so I committed to spending time getting prepared. I met with a math coach the 3 fridays I was home for break. Throughout the week I would go over concepts on my own, then he would come and I worked through problems and discussed content. Over those three weeks math began to feel like basketball for me. I was putting in work on my own, during the time most people weren't, I was refining my skills and then putting in the time and taking reps. When I got to school, I was already ahead. Much like I felt I had always been during my basketball career. I was already familiar with the concepts when they were presented in class. But I didn't stop there, I read the textbook before class, and did all the math problems assigned without taking any shortcuts. Friday nights I was on the whiteboard taking time to get the math problems right and repping them to make sure I really knew it. Just like hours spent in the gym refining my jump shot. 

The test reviews got released. I buzzed through them. Practice problems, routine. Night before test I reviewed concepts, breezed through the last years test and got to bed early. I got to the test, went through 9 of the 10 multiple choice with ease, and was a little unsure of the tenth but positive it was between the two answers that I narrowed it down to. The first free response was easy, the second not much tougher. Then I came to the third one and I couldn't see it. 20 minutes left in the test had been announced and I was staring at this problem but couldn't think of it. I had done plenty like it but for some reason the strategies that came to mind weren't working. As the last 5 minutes were announced I managed to start down a path towards an answer I thought might be right but wasn't able to get far. 

When I got my test back I'd realize I had missed game winning free throws. The problem was one I had done plenty of variations of. It was a tougher one, most of the class had missed it. But most of the class hadn't been in the gym getting shots up. Oh and the last multiple choice was the other of the two I had been deliberating between (of course it was the one I had initially circled then went away from). Lets say I had kept my original answer to this last multiple choice, I would have answered the 12/12 for the first 12 questions of the test. Then I got 2/14 points on the last question of the test.
